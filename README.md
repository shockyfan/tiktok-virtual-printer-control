# Hey there!

Some days ago I built this POC of a virtual printer controlled by TikTok Events.
Maybe you can use it for your own projects.

## Setup
### Backend
Just install dependencies, add your username (Or someone else, has to be live) and run.
### Frontend
Install dependencies and build the frontend (npm run build).
